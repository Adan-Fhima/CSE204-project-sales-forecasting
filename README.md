# Machine Learning Project: Sales Prediction

Welcome to the repository for my **Machine Learning Project**, focused on predicting sales using advanced data processing and modeling techniques. This project combines data integration, feature engineering, and analysis to develop a robust predictive model.

---

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to accurately predict sales by leveraging multiple datasets that provide rich contextual information about stores, transactions, promotions, holidays, and external economic factors like oil prices. By carefully integrating and analyzing these datasets, we aim to extract meaningful insights that drive predictive performance.

## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Comprehensive exploration of datasets to understand features, trends, and relationships.
   - Addressed challenges like missing values, duplicate records, and large-scale data processing.

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Merged datasets to create a unified view, including store metadata, transaction records, holiday information, and economic indicators like oil prices.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created meaningful features such as holiday impact, promotional effects, and economic trends to enhance the predictive model.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective approach for sales prediction.
   - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and generalizability.

5. **Insights and Analysis:**
   - Analyzed key factors affecting sales, including promotions, holidays, and regional variations, to uncover actionable business insights.
